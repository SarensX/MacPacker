## Why?

- Because essential tools should be free
- Because open source creates a community for long-time maintenance
- Because extracting the full archive to get just one file doesn't make sense

## What is MacPacker?

A free, open-source, tool to work with archives. Currently, it supports navigating and extracting files from an archive only. Creating or editing archives will follow. Inspired by 7-Zip, but without any claim to comparability. See the roadmap for more details.
